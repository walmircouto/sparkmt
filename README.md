SparkMT: Aligning an ATL-like ExecutionModel with Apache Spark
One central operation in Model-Driven Engineering (MDE)is rule-based model transformations (MT). Being based on computation-ally expensive operations, and as models that are being handled by MDEapproaches grow in scale, MT tools are facing issues such as memory oc-cupancy, scalability, and execution time. A couple of works are arisingto improve these issues. However, a large part of them provide solutionsbuilt from existing frameworks, which diminish the exploration possibil-ities.  In  this  paper,  we  present  a  solution,  called  SparkMT,  for  modeltransformations that explores the Apache Spark processing framework.We take the ATL execution semantics as basis guide and we present analignment of its semantics within the Spark framework. We do not in-tend to provide a full alignment, but to be inspired by its well-knownsemantics, yet providing a different application. We present a functionalexecution semantics, and we propose to map models in JSON into theDataset/DataFrames format to deal with Very Large Models (VLMs).We develop experiments and compared with a plain ATL execution. Theresults show a large potential of the solution for improving transforma-tions execution performance.
