SparkMT: Aligning an ATL-like ExecutionModel with Apache Spark

One central operation in Model-Driven Engineering (MDE)is rule-based model transformations (MT). Being based on computationally expensive operations, and as models that are being handled by MDEapproaches grow in scale, MT tools are facing issues such as memory occupancy, scalability, and execution time. A couple of works are arisingto improve these issues. However, a large part of them provide solutionsbuilt from existing frameworks, which diminish the exploration possibilities. We  present  a  solution,  called  SparkMT, for model transformations that explores the Apache Spark processing framework. We take the ATL execution semantics as basis guide and we present analignment of its semantics within the Spark framework. We do not intend to provide a full alignment, but to be inspired by its well-known semantics, yet providing a different application. We present a functional execution semantics, and we propose to map models in JSON into the Dataset/DataFrames format to deal with Very Large Models (VLMs). We develop experiments and compared with a plain ATL execution. The results show a large potential of the solution for improving transforma-tions execution performance.
